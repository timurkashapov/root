 *
 * Object-Oriented Design with Applications has long been the essential reference to object-oriented technology,
 * which, in turn, has evolved to join the mainstream of industrial-strength software development.
 * In this third edition--the first revision in 13 years--readers can learn to apply object-oriented methods using new paradigms such as Java,
 * the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.0, and .NET.
 *
 * The authors draw upon their rich and varied experience to offer improved methods for object development and
 * numerous examples that tackle the complex problems faced by software engineers,
 * including systems architecture, data acquisition, cryptoanalysis, control systems, and Web development.
 * They illustrate essential concepts, explain the method, and show successful applications in a variety of fields.
 * You'll also find pragmatic advice on a host of issues, including classification, implementation strategies, and cost-effective project management.
 *
 * New to this new edition are
 *
 * An introduction to the new UML 2.0, from the notation's most fundamental and advanced elements with an emphasis on key changes
 *
 * New domains and contexts
 * A greatly enhanced focus on modeling--as eagerly requested by readers--with five chapters that each delve into one phase of the overall development lifecycle.
 * Fresh approaches to reasoning about complex systems
 * An examination of the conceptual foundation of the widely misunderstood fundamental elements of the object model, such as abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, and hierarchy
 * How to allocate the resources of a team of developers and mange the risks associated with developing complex software systems
 * An appendix on object-oriented programming languages
 * This is the seminal text for anyone who wishes to use object-oriented technology to manage the complexity inherent in many kinds of systems.
